I’m a third year PhD student at <a href="https://cmap.ip-paris.fr">CMAP (Ecole Polytechnique)</a>. My research is focused on conditional generative models. I’m supervised by David Picard and Vicky Kalogeiton. Before my PhD, I graduated from the MVA master (Mathematiques, Vision et Apprentissage) at ENS Paris Saclay and I got my engineering degree from Telecom SudParis following the MSA specialization (Mathematics and Statistical Modeling). I’ve also done an internship at Meta London, in the Pytorch team where I contributed to the TorchRL library focusing on Model Based Reinforcement Learning.

During my PhD, I have worked on GANs with a focus on semantically conditioned GANs and I am currently working on diffusion models. I also have a high interest in the current development of the field of generative models around Large Language Models.


My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
