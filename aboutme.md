I’m a third year PhD student at <a href="https://cmap.ip-paris.fr">CMAP (Ecole Polytechnique)</a>. My research is focused on Bayesian Sampling with Variational inference. I’m supervised by <a href="https://akorba.github.io/Publications.html">Anna Korba</a> , <a href="https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr">Alain Durmus</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr">Eric Moulines</a>. Before my PhD, I graduated from the MVA master (Mathematiques, Vision et Apprentissage) at ENS Paris Saclay and I got my engineering degree from CentraleSupélec following the SDI-PS specialization (Sciences des données et de l'information, Paris Saclay).

During my PhD, I have worked on GANs with a focus on semantically conditioned GANs and I am currently working on diffusion models. I also have a high interest in the current development of the field of generative models around Large Language Models.


My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
